This project implemented K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm and Condensed KNN and find the best k value for KNN and Condensed KNN to classify each of the Classification data set and make predictions in Regression data sets.

This project also implemented a K-Means algorithm incombination with KNN, a Radial Basis Function Network to perform similar tasks for comparison purpose.
